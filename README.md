# Bamazon

This project was designed to be an Amazon like store front listing several items available for purchase, their ID number from an SQL Database and their purchase price.  The user can then select an item and the app will determine if there is enough stock to fill the order.  If there is enough stock the app will show the user the final purchase price.  If not the app will show the user an error saying that there is not enought stock to fill the order.

# Build status
The base level build is complete and working properly.  Build extensions including a Supervisor and Manager view will be on future development.


# Code style
